# Human Approval Ledger (the gates)

*Human-in-the-loop, recorded and delegated by role (see ROLES.md). The Orchestrator must NOT proceed
past a gate until the named approver records it here. `validate.py` treats an open P0 or a missing
required gate as a blocker. An empty "Approved by" = NOT approved.*

There are **8 gates (G0–G6, plus G3a)**. G0 is new in v3: Cambium does not brainstorm until the PI is known.

**Presentation format:** every gate is presented with the fixed one-pager `templates/GATE_SUMMARY.md` (Decision needed · Where we are · Options · Risks · Evidence & confidence · Recommendation · APPROVE/REVISE/REJECT). Approval is then recorded in the table below.

| Gate | Decision | Approver role | Approved by (name) | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0  | is the PI profile ready?   | Director       |  |  | USER_PROFILE.md exists |
| G1  | pursue this RFP?            | Director       |  |  |  |
| G2  | which idea advances?       | Director (+Co-PIs) |  |  |  |
| G3a | who to contact?            | Director       |  |  |  |
| G3  | finalize & submit proposal | Director only  |  |  |  |
| G4  | apply fixes (workstream)   | Area Lead (that Aim) |  |  |  |
| G5  | release report             | Director or Area Lead |  |  |  |
| G6  | publish / external send    | Director only + co-authors |  |  |  |

Separation of duties: the author of a deliverable is not its sole approver; G3 and G6 need the Director
**plus** a second human. External sends (submit, publish, email) are always a human action.

| G-outline | 2026-06-26 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Write the full 16-section world-class README to the approved architecture; then assets pass + verify. |

| G-logo2 | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Adopt the "Governed Growth Ring" mark v2 (8 gates + PI + sweep + caught-error) across logo/wordmark/social/favicon. |
| G-logo3 | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE (blend) | Final "Living Tree" mark — tree of life + growth rings + 8 gates + sweep + caught-error + PI at roots. |

| G-repairs | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the scorecard repairs: gate.py Learning-Gate enforcement, citation_support blocking, NIST bias module, regulated-data control, AI_MODEL CI, + multi-institution spec. |
| G-stage1 | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept inline gate cards (default), Learning-Gate auto-fire on every decision gate (Act III contract), and multi-PI Stage-1 named-approver roles (gate.py --required-approver + MULTI_PI_ROLES.yml). |
| G-support | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the Support-council doc refresh (ROADMAP/README/USE_CAMBIUM), duplicate-ADR fix, and the automatic close-out (tools/closeout.py + CLOSEOUT_CHECKLIST + Act IV mandate) that fails close-out on doc drift. |
| G-threads | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the Learning-Gate hard runtime lock (gate_lock.py token interlock), the A/B task set expansion 12->18, and multi-PI Stage-1.5 (roles_check.py + gate.py --roles auto-lookup). |
| G-readme-fix | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | (drift fix) | README prose refreshed for gate_lock/roles/18-tasks; closeout.py hardened to catch README tool-count + unreferenced-tool drift. |
| G-vision | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Adopt VISION.md + AI_POLICY.md as canonical — reviewer's writeup fact-checked the Cambium way (Integrity + Research-Conduct), partials hedged honestly. |
| G-enforce-all | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Make the Partial policy points enforced: pace_check.py (deliberation interval), learning_gate change-tracking (#3), data_scan.py (#6 detection), enforce.py gauntlet + CI (#2). #9 stays honestly Partial. |

Integrity audit fixed a README↔dashboard test-count contradiction (now 168 everywhere). |
| G-dashboard-auto | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Make the eval dashboard self-updating: tools/gen_dashboard.py regenerates assets/benchmark_dashboard.html from live tool output; CI regenerates + git-diffs so the dashboard can never drift from reality. |
