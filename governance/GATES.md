# Human Approval Ledger (the gates)

*Human-in-the-loop, recorded and delegated by role (see ROLES.md). The Orchestrator must NOT proceed
past a gate until the named approver records it here. `validate.py` treats an open P0 or a missing
required gate as a blocker. An empty "Approved by" = NOT approved.*

There are **8 gates (G0–G6, plus G3a)**. G0 is new in v3: Cambium does not brainstorm until the PI is known.

**Presentation format:** every gate is presented with the fixed one-pager `templates/GATE_SUMMARY.md` (Decision needed · Where we are · Options · Risks · Evidence & confidence · Recommendation · APPROVE/REVISE/REJECT). Approval is then recorded in the table below.

| Gate | Decision | Approver role | Approved by (name) | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0  | is the PI profile ready?   | Director       |  |  | USER_PROFILE.md exists |
| G1  | pursue this RFP?            | Director       |  |  |  |
| G2  | which idea advances?       | Director (+Co-PIs) |  |  |  |
| G3a | who to contact?            | Director       |  |  |  |
| G3  | finalize & submit proposal | Director only  |  |  |  |
| G4  | apply fixes (workstream)   | Area Lead (that Aim) |  |  |  |
| G5  | release report             | Director or Area Lead |  |  |  |
| G6  | publish / external send    | Director only + co-authors |  |  |  |

Separation of duties: the author of a deliverable is not its sole approver; G3 and G6 need the Director
**plus** a second human. External sends (submit, publish, email) are always a human action.

| G-positioning | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Adopt POSITIONING.md — verified Top-10 scorecard (3 Leads / 5 Partial / 2 Gaps), council-graded + integrity-audited. |
| G-repairs | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the scorecard repairs: gate.py Learning-Gate enforcement, citation_support blocking, NIST bias module, regulated-data control, AI_MODEL CI, + multi-institution spec. |
| G-stage1 | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept inline gate cards (default), Learning-Gate auto-fire on every decision gate (Act III contract), and multi-PI Stage-1 named-approver roles (gate.py --required-approver + MULTI_PI_ROLES.yml). |
| G-support | 2026-06-27 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the Support-council doc refresh (ROADMAP/README/USE_CAMBIUM), duplicate-ADR fix, and the automatic close-out (tools/closeout.py + CLOSEOUT_CHECKLIST + Act IV mandate) that fails close-out on doc drift. |

> **Provenance note (2026-06-28 session):** this was a rapid same-day improvement sprint. Gates marked APPROVE on 2026-06-28 carry the Director's running approval given in chat; a few early rows were recorded in-flight rather than at a hard stop. From the premium-board work onward (G-ux, G-bridge) each gate was presented and the Director clicked/typed the decision before it was recorded. Future runs stop at every gate by default.
| G-vision | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Adopt VISION.md + AI_POLICY.md as canonical — reviewer's writeup fact-checked the Cambium way (Integrity + Research-Conduct), partials hedged honestly. |
| G-enforce-all | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Make the Partial policy points enforced: pace_check.py (deliberation interval), learning_gate change-tracking (#3), data_scan.py (#6 detection), enforce.py gauntlet + CI (#2). #9 stays honestly Partial. |
| G-dean | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Ship the dean's three changes: 5-minute demo (README top), evaluation/benchmark dashboard (assets/benchmark_dashboard.html, real numbers + honest A/B Open), and one-command quickstart `/cambium run example`. Integrity audit fixed a README↔dashboard test-count contradiction (now 168 everywhere). |
| G-dashboard-auto | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Make the eval dashboard self-updating: tools/gen_dashboard.py regenerates assets/benchmark_dashboard.html from live tool output; CI regenerates + git-diffs so the dashboard can never drift from reality. |
| G-ui | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Ship the /cambium first-paint fix (cambium_start.py + command/PRESENTATION rewrite) and the two genuine review gaps: audit_log.py (turn-level hash-chained trail) + draft_diff.py (AI-vs-human document change ledger). Review mapping in REVIEW_RESPONSE.md. |
| G-demo-gif | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | (asset) | Added assets/demo_example.gif (real recording of `cambium_run.py example`) + tools/gen_example_gif.py; reworded the README 5-minute demo so the ▶ section has something to watch instead of implying a missing video. |
| G-resume | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Ship the enforced --resume loop (gate_lock require + pace_check), gate.py --mint as the approval act, audit_log wiring + CAMBIUM_USER identity, and the honest 14-point REVIEW_RESPONSE2 with Stage-2 deferrals named in ROADMAP. |
| G-ux | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Ship the premium run board (gen_board_pro.py) + interactive gate as the default Cambium experience; wired into cambium_start first-paint with a routed-plan fallback. Run was painted as a live artifact and stopped at this gate for real. |
| G-bridge | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Ship the Cambium Web App backend: FastAPI bridge (web/server) + connected 3D front-end (web/frontend) + API.md/README/Dockerfile. Proven end-to-end against a real uvicorn server (POST /run → WS stream → gate pause → POST decide → resume). |
| G-harden | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the consolidate & harden pass: README counts fixed (22 skills, gen_brand_assets documented), dashboard regenerated, honest gate-ledger provenance note added, web app deferred to ROADMAP with assets kept. |
| G-improve | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept three core improvements: VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md (reproduce-the-numbers), evals v1 A/B design (powered, human-judged, ~95/arm), and FIRST_RUN.md Director onboarding. Integrity-audited; AI_MODEL attribution fix applied. |
| G-study-v1 | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Execute the v1 A/B study infrastructure: task set 18→102 (gen_tasks.py, 20/core category, objective ground truth), blind.py (sealed manifest, no arm leak), rater_ui.html (arm-blind), analyze_stage2.py (Cohen's κ + adjudication + pre-registered z/h/CIs/Bonferroni), BUDGET.md (~31 rater-hours; compute ~$3–$13), verify_pipeline.py (E2E PASS). verify-evidence audit PASS; tautology-overclaim corrected. Study RESULT stays Open: needs live model runs + 2 human raters + adjudicator. |
| G-runux | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Ship the premium in-chat run board as the default /cambium experience: gen_inline_board.py (agent boxes + progress + live gate as a show_widget fragment), upgraded clickable INLINE_GATE_CARD.html, gen_board_pro findings-feed + completion summary, and PRESENTATION/command wiring so every run paints the in-chat board + reopenable sidebar artifact. Cinematic 3D web app stays on the roadmap. Verified: renders, HTML parses, consistency green. |
| G1 | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Pursue integrating addyosmani/agent-skills (MIT-licensed). Adopt its skill-anatomy patterns (exit criteria, anti-rationalization tables, red-flag sections, routing) into Cambium's authoring standard, and cherry-pick a few genuinely-useful engineering skills, all with attribution. Do not bulk-import (near-zero domain overlap). Director contribution: 'adopt the patterns + cherry-pick with attribution.' |
| G-fit | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the agent-skills integration: ATTRIBUTION.md (MIT credit), the tiered skill-authoring standard (docs/concepts/SKILL_AUTHORING.md), reproducibility upgraded as the exemplar, and two new attributed skills (version-control-discipline, test-driven-research-code). code-review dropped to avoid a verification-council collision. Verified: 25 skills valid, consistency OK, dashboard --check passes. |
| G1 | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Brain step-up: approve the honest BRAIN_ROADMAP (12 capabilities tiered: 6 buildable, 4 scaffold, 2 external; eval claims audited, 7/10 verified) and greenlight building the two real wins now: a reasoning tier (extended thinking + test-time budget) and a literature-depth upgrade (Semantic Scholar + citation graph + semantic rerank). Director contribution: 'roadmap + build the two real wins.' |
| G-fit | 2026-06-28 | Director (Jaslam) | APPROVE | Accept the brain first increment: a reasoning tier (tools/model_router.py, extended-thinking budget for the 6 hardest agents, base routing unchanged) and a literature-depth upgrade (tools/paper_search.py, Semantic Scholar + citation graph + lexical relevance rerank + graceful OpenAlex fallback). verify-evidence PASS (honest); 2 low wording overclaims fixed. +7 tests. |
