# Human Approval Ledger (the gates)

*Human-in-the-loop, recorded and delegated by role (see ROLES.md). The Orchestrator must NOT proceed
past a gate until the named approver records it here. `validate.py` treats an open P0 or a missing
required gate as a blocker. An empty "Approved by" = NOT approved.*

| Gate | Decision | Approver role | Approved by (name) | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1  | pursue this RFP?            | Director       |  |  |  |
| G2  | which idea advances?       | Director (+Co-PIs) |  |  |  |
| G3a | who to contact?            | Director       |  |  |  |
| G3  | finalize & submit proposal | Director only  |  |  |  |
| G4  | apply fixes (workstream)   | Area Lead (that Aim) |  |  |  |
| G5  | release report             | Director or Area Lead |  |  |  |
| G6  | publish / external send    | Director only + co-authors |  |  |  |

Separation of duties: the author of a deliverable is not its sole approver; G3 and G6 need the Director
**plus** a second human. External sends (submit, publish, email) are always a human action.
