"""cambium_start — Act I "first paint" in ONE command, so /cambium can never silently fall back to plain text.

The Cambium way is a contract (docs/concepts/PRESENTATION.md), and contracts get skipped under load. The most common
failure the Director sees is: typed `/cambium <task>`, got a plain text answer — no live run board, no
named agents, no gate. The cause is that Act I used to be three separate tool calls; the easy path was to
skip them. This collapses Act I to a single deterministic call:

  python3 tools/cambium_start.py "<task>"

It (1) resets the run state, (2) prints the branded text board (renders in ANY client), (3) writes the
live HTML board, and (4) prints an explicit FIRST-PAINT banner telling the model exactly what to do next
(publish the HTML as a 'Cambium run board' artifact, then dispatch Phase 1). One call = the UI is painted.

  --out PATH   where to write the HTML board (default: agent_outputs/run_board.html)
  --no-reset   keep the existing run state (for mid-run re-paints)
Exit: 0 always (first paint must never block the run).
