"""Cambium Task Router — pick the councils a task needs, build a phase plan.

Given ANY task ("build an app", "review this code", "win an NSF grant"), classify it and emit a
custom multi-phase plan: which councils/agents activate, which run in parallel, and where the human
gates fall. Deterministic + keyword-based (no API key needed). The engine + app consume this so
council selection is Cambium's, not hand-picked.

Usage: python3 tools/task_router.py "your task here"
