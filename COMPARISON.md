# Comparison: Cambium vs Comparable Systems

> **Honest positioning.** Every competitor description below was web-verified before writing.
> We claim what is demonstrably true; we do not overclaim.
> The single defensible differentiator is stated once and clearly in the verdict row.

## How to read this table

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | Where in the research lifecycle does the tool operate? |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Are there mandatory human approval gates, or can the system run fully autonomously? |
| **Evidence / Verification** | Does the system verify claims by running code, or does it rely on model-generated assertions? |
| **Governance policy** | Does the system ship an explicit, enforced AI-use policy (authorship, IRB, FERPA, dual-use, etc.)? |
| **Field-agnostic** | Can it work outside machine learning / biomedicine without code changes? |
| **Install model** | How do you get it running? |

## Comparison Table

| System | Scope | Human-in-the-loop | Evidence / Verification | Governance policy | Field-agnostic | Install model |
|--------|-------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Cambium** (this tool) | **Full lifecycle: RFP intake → grant proposal → collaborator sourcing → gated development → code-verified results → reports / decks** | **Mandatory at 6 named gates** (G1–G6). Nothing submitted, sent, or published without recorded President approval. No autonomous external actions. | **Unified 5-field output contract** across all 34 agents: severity P0/P1/P2 + claim tier (Proved / Code-verified / Asserted / Open). Verification board *runs your code and reproduces numbers*. `governance/validate.py` **fails the build** on an open P0 or un-evidenced claim. | **Ships `AI_GOVERNANCE.md`**: authorship (AI not author), disclosure, IRB, FERPA, data sovereignty, dual-use, incident response. Enforced by construction via gated gates + validator. | Yes — domain expertise lives in a parameterized `faculty-expert` config; any field on demand. | GitHub template ("Use this template") + Claude plugin marketplace. Copy `.claude/agents/`. |
| **Sakana AI Scientist / v2** | Idea → LaTeX paper + simulated peer review. ML / deep-learning focused. ~$15/paper. | **Designed for full autonomy** — "no human intervention except initial preparation." Human not required at any stage. | Runs ML experiments with PyTorch/GPU; writes the paper from those runs. No unified claim-tier contract across agents. | No explicit governance policy shipped. | **No** — requires PyTorch + GPU; optimized for ML paper templates. v2 generalizes across ML domains but not outside ML. | Open-source clone (GitHub: SakanaAI/AI-Scientist). |
| **Google DeepMind AI Co-Scientist** | **Front of funnel only**: literature-grounded hypothesis and experiment-design generation. Does not draft proposals, run lab code, or produce reports. | Framed as human-complementing; researchers review hypotheses. No formal approval-gate architecture. | Elo-style "idea tournament" debate between agents; grounded in literature/databases. Does not re-run code to verify claims. | No explicit governance policy. Data handled by Google/Gemini terms. | Validated primarily in biomedicine (oncology, drug repurposing). Accessible via Gemini for Science. | Cloud service (Gemini for Science access request); not self-hostable. |
| **Agent Laboratory** (Schmidgall et al.) | Literature Review → Experimentation → Report Writing. ML-leaning. PhD/Postdoc/Professor role structure. | **Co-pilot mode** provides checkpoints; autonomous mode runs without intervention. Checkpoints are informal, not formally gated with a recorded decision ledger. | Runs ML code experiments; writes academic report. No unified evidence-tier output contract across agents. | No explicit governance policy. | **ML-leaning**; not designed for non-computational fields or pre-award stages. | Open-source (GitHub: SamuelSchmidgall/AgentLaboratory). |
| **Stanford Virtual Lab** (Zou et al., Nature 2025) | Idea → research discovery (demonstrated on nanobody design). An AI "PI" runs lab meetings with specialist agents. | Human proposes question and monitors lab meetings; framed as human-complementing. No formal approval gates or decision ledger. | Agents reason and design; wet-lab validation done externally by humans. No code-verification contract. | No explicit governance policy. | **Narrow** — applied to one biological design problem; not a reusable cross-field template or plugin. | Research prototype; not publicly installable as of 2026. |
| **AutoGen / CrewAI crews** | General-purpose multi-agent orchestration. Research "crews" are example templates, not a governed institution. | Human-in-the-loop patterns available but optional and not domain-opinionated. No mandatory gate architecture. | No domain-specific evidence-tier contract. Depends entirely on how the user configures the crew. | No governance policy. Policy-before-dispatch must be added by the user. | Yes — general-purpose frameworks. | pip install / npm; requires bespoke configuration per use case. |

## The honest differentiator

No existing system spans the **full institutional lifecycle** — RFP → grant proposal → collaborator sourcing → gated development → code-verified results → reports and decks — as one human-governed, field-agnostic operating system.

- **Academic systems** (Sakana, Agent Lab, Virtual Lab, Co-Scientist) stop at **idea → paper** or **idea → hypothesis**. They do not touch pre-award or post-award reporting.
- **Commercial grant tools** (Granted AI, SteerLab, Grantable) cover the grant lifecycle through proposal submission. They do not touch the science: no experiment execution, no code verification, no paper or final deliverable.
- **General frameworks** (AutoGen, CrewAI) are substrates, not opinionated research institutions.

**The Cambium is the only one that joins pre-award and post-award under one evidence contract, with mandatory human gates at every phase boundary, and a shipped, enforceable governance policy.**

That is a claim about *integration and category*, not about being "better" at any single component. Every primitive — autonomous pipeline, role-based crew, human checkpoints, reproduce-before-report, grant drafting — exists in some other shipped system. What does not exist elsewhere is the combination.

## What competitors do better (be honest)

| Competitor | Where they excel vs the Institute |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Sakana AI Scientist | Fully autonomous end-to-end ML paper production; no human time required; ~$15/paper; proven at scale |
| Google AI Co-Scientist | Richer literature-grounded hypothesis ranking (Elo tournament); backed by DeepMind compute; cloud-managed reliability |
| Agent Laboratory | Cheaper per run (84% cost reduction vs prior methods); lighter-weight setup for pure ML experimentation |
| Stanford Virtual Lab | Demonstrated wet-lab validated biological discovery (Nature, 2025) |
| AutoGen / CrewAI | Maximum flexibility; not opinionated; integrate with any LLM or tool; large community |
| Grant-writing tools | Deeper funder database search (133K+ foundations); compliance checking for specific funders |
