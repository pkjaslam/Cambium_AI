# The Cambium Way — Presentation Contract

> This is the single source of truth for **how a Cambium run looks and feels**. When the Director
> chooses *the Cambium way* (or types `/cambium`), the Orchestrator MUST present the run as the four
> acts below. The point is that every Cambium run is unmistakable, legible, and the same every time —
> the Director always sees *which named agents are working, on what, and where the gates are.*
>
> Solo runs ignore this file. This contract is only for the Cambium way.

The anti-goal is the generic experience: opaque "Used 6 tools / Created 3 files" lines with no named
agents, no visible plan, no live progress. That is what this contract exists to replace.

## The brand (use everywhere)

- Mark: **⬢ CAMBIUM INSTITUTE** · tagline *"the Cambium way"*.
- Palette: deep forest `#07231A`, panels `#0E3326`, hairline `#1F4D3B`, **Cambium lime `#B7F36A`** (primary
  accent / "now"), emerald `#16C079` (flow / done), ink `#F4F7F2`, muted `#8AA197`.
- Status glyphs, used identically in every view: **✓ done · ▶ now · ○ waiting · ⛩ human gate · ▸ NOW line**.
- Council vocabulary (always title-case, always "Council · Role"): Orchestration, Pre-Award,
  Partnerships, Faculty, Scouts, Labs, Verification, Execution, Reporting, Support, Governance.

All boards are produced by `tools/run_trace.py` so the vocabulary never drifts. Never hand-draw a board.

## Act I — OPENING (before any work)

Transparency before action. The moment the Cambium way starts, show the plan so the Director sees the
whole institute that is about to mobilize.

> ⛔ **FIRST PAINT IS ONE COMMAND — and it is non-negotiable.** Your first action, before any prose, is:
> ```
> python3 tools/cambium_start.py "<request>"
> ```
> It does Act I in a single call: resets the run state, prints the branded **text board** (renders in ANY
> client — the non-negotiable baseline), writes the **live HTML board** to `agent_outputs/run_board.html`,
> and prints a banner telling you what to do next. Collapsing Act I to one call is deliberate — three
> separate calls were easy to skip, and a plain-text answer to `/cambium` is the single failure this
> contract exists to prevent.

After running it:
1. **In Cowork / visual clients — paint TWO surfaces:**
   - **In-chat live board (agent boxes):** run `python3 tools/gen_inline_board.py` and pass its stdout to
     `mcp__visualize__show_widget` (title *"Cambium run board"*). This is the in-chat board the Director
     watches — agent boxes that read done / working / queued, a progress rail, each finding, and the live
     gate card. Re-run it at the start of every phase so the board updates in place.
   - **Reopenable sidebar board:** publish `agent_outputs/run_board.html` (from `gen_board_pro.py`) as an
     artifact (`create_artifact`) titled *"Cambium run board"* and keep its id — a standalone page the
     Director can reopen any time; update the SAME artifact each phase.
2. One plain sentence under it: *"Here's the institute I'll run for this — N specialists across M
   councils, with K gates where you decide. Starting now."*

Never start dispatching before the opening board is shown. If you are about to reply without the board,
STOP and run `cambium_start.py` first.

## Act II — LIVE PHASES (dispatch real agents, narrate by phase)

This is the heart of the upgrade: **dispatch the real, named sub-agents** — do not do their work inline.

**END-TO-END RULE (non-negotiable).** If the Director chose the Cambium way, the *entire* task runs the
Cambium way — including the BUILD/implementation phases that come **after** an approval gate. The
Orchestrator dispatches the real Execution/Labs agents (`research-engineer`, `exec-experiments`,
`exec-iteration`, `lab-methods`, …) to do the work; it does **not** quietly do the build itself inline.
Doing the post-gate work solo is a contract violation. The only allowed alternative is to **ask the
Director first** — e.g. "the build is mechanical; run it Cambium (dispatch Execution) or drop to solo for
speed?" — and honor their answer. Never switch to solo silently.

**Dispatch rule (mandatory).** For each agent in a phase, spawn it with the Task tool:
- `subagent_type` = `cambium-institute:<agent-name>` (e.g. `cambium-institute:scout-landscape`,
  `cambium-institute:verify-rigor`, `cambium-institute:lab-statistics`).
- `description` = the **"Council · Role"** label (e.g. `Scouts · Landscape`). Cowork's native
  "Running agent" cards show this verbatim, so the live UI speaks the same vocabulary as the board.
- Agents in the same phase that are independent are dispatched **in parallel** (one message, multiple
  Task calls).

**Per-phase narration (mandatory).** At the start of every phase, re-emit the LIVE board so the Director
sees ✓/▶/○ advance:
- Text: `python3 tools/run_trace.py --board "<request>"`
- Cowork in-chat board: re-run `python3 tools/gen_inline_board.py` and re-render it with
  `mcp__visualize__show_widget` (the agent boxes update in place).
- Cowork sidebar board: regenerate `run_board.html` and `update_artifact` (same id).

The board's live detail comes from **`agent_outputs/run_state.json`**, which `run_trace.py`
**auto-discovers** — so you do NOT pass `--state` and you do NOT hand-edit JSON. Maintain it with
`tools/run_state.py`, which lifts each agent's headline finding from its own output file automatically:
```bash
python3 tools/run_state.py phase 2 --note "Scouts surveying the landscape"
# … dispatch the real agents; each writes agent_outputs/<name>.md …
python3 tools/run_state.py sync --phase 2          # auto-fills findings from every agent's "## Decision"
python3 tools/run_state.py lead "scout-landscape:92,scout-methods:88"   # optional leaderboard
python3 tools/run_state.py gate G2 "which idea advances?" --rec "A"     # arm the gate banner
python3 tools/run_trace.py --board "<request>"     # reads run_state.json; no --state needed
```
`run_state.json` is the live, per-run state (git-ignored). Schema:
`{ "phase": N, "note": "…", "findings": {"<agent>": "one line"},
   "leaderboard": [["<agent>", score]], "gate": {"id","kind","decision","recommendation"} }`.
Findings keys are agent names; the board prints them next to each agent. (You may still pass an explicit
`--state path.json` to override auto-discovery.)

Between phases, keep the findings ledger (`agent_outputs/findings_ledger.csv`) and the master synthesis
current, exactly as INSTITUTE.md / the Orchestrator spec require. The board is the *view*; the ledger is
the *record*.

## Act III — THE GATE (stop, show one page, wait)

**Learning by doing (build/analysis runs).** Before the results or report gate on any build or analysis, the **teaching-assistant** runs the `learn` step and produces `templates/LEARNING_BRIEF.md` filled in for the actual work: a plain-language what-and-why, a real architecture diagram (mermaid), the decisions and tradeoffs, the concepts to understand, and an open invitation for the Director to ask follow-ups. This is the Learning Gate doing its real job, the human leaves understanding the work, not just approving it.


At every gate, render the gate card and STOP. Three synchronized surfaces:
- **The one-pager:** fill `templates/GATE_SUMMARY.md` VERBATIM — the 7 sections **plus the required Section 8 (Director contribution)**, in order,
  ≤ 1 page. Never improvise the structure.
- **The inline gate card (default):** render `templates/INLINE_GATE_CARD.html` with `mcp__visualize__show_widget`
  (fill `{GATE_ID}` / `{DECISION}`). Its APPROVE / REVISE / REJECT buttons actually post the decision to chat
  (`sendPrompt`) — a sidebar artifact canNOT, so the inline card is the canonical clickable gate.
- **The sidebar run board (Cowork):** the dashboard shows the active-gate banner; its buttons only copy the
  decision text (a sidebar artifact has no send-to-chat hook).

**ENFORCE BEFORE RECORDING (mandatory).** Before recording any DECISION-gate APPROVE in `governance/GATES.md`,
the Orchestrator MUST run the gate interlock — and it does not record an APPROVE if the interlock blocks:
```
python3 tools/gate.py <GATE_ID> --require-contribution --contribution <director.json> [--ai-summary <card.txt>] \
        [--required-approver "<named approver from templates/MULTI_PI_ROLES.yml>" --approver "<who is approving>"]
```
This makes the Learning Gate (a real Director contribution) and — for multi-institution projects — the
named-approver / separation-of-duties check fire on **every** decision gate, not by convention. A bare APPROVE,
an incomplete contribution, or the wrong approver is blocked.

**HARD LOCK (open thread #2).** On a recorded APPROVE, mint a tamper-evident token:
`python3 tools/gate_lock.py mint <GATE_ID> --approver "<name>" [--contribution <c.json>] [--ledger <L>]` (no
token is minted unless the ledger AND contribution pass). Any post-gate BUILD/release step then begins with
`python3 tools/gate_lock.py require <GATE_ID>` and **does not run without a valid token** — so the gate is a
runtime interlock for every step that calls it, not just a contract. (Use `--roles templates/MULTI_PI_ROLES.yml`
on multi-institution projects to look the required approver up automatically.)

End with the explicit **APPROVE / REVISE / REJECT** prompt and WAIT. Record the answer in
`governance/GATES.md` only after `gate.py` opens the gate. Never submit, publish, or finalize without an APPROVE.

---

## Act IV — CLOSE-OUT (every time something ships)

After a change is approved, **dispatch the real Support council** (do NOT do close-out inline — that is
what lets the support staff "just sit" and the docs drift): Record-Keeper appends the CHANGELOG + ADR +
GATES; **Outreach refreshes the forward docs — README counts + roadmap paragraph, ROADMAP.md (+ bump
`Last updated:`), USE_CAMBIUM / FAQ / COMPARISON if user-facing**; Integrity-Officer updates POSITIONING /
PHILOSOPHY if any claim moved and runs tests/doctor; Janitor checks for stray files. Follow
`templates/CLOSEOUT_CHECKLIST.md`. **Then `python3 tools/closeout.py` MUST exit 0** — it fails close-out if a
forward doc drifted behind the latest CHANGELOG. Close-out is not "done" until it passes.

**The learn step is now enforced.** Every build or analysis run delivers a learning packet to the Director by default — a plain-language explainer, glossary, flashcards, and a short quiz written to `agent_outputs/learning_packet.md` and presented in chat, not just filed. The full interactive Learning Lab (tools/gen_learning_lab.py) is always offered as the next step. `tools/learning_delivery.py` is the deterministic check that makes this non-skippable: close-out fails if no filled learning packet or lab was delivered to the Director during the run.

Then show the **final board** with every phase ✓ and a 3–5 line "what shipped" summary
(`--board --phase <last>`), and in Cowork a final dashboard u
