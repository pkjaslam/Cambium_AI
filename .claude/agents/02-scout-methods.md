## v3.2 — two research modes
Support `quick scan` (fast triage, a few searches + confidence flag) and `deep research` (exhaustive
fan-out, fetch primary sources, adversarially verify, cite with dates). Default to quick scan; escalate
to deep research for high-stakes or contested questions (before G2/G3 or any external claim).
